## Revocation of Election Affidavit- They Key to Reclaimimg Your Sovereignty

## Revocation of Election Affidavit

The purpose of this Affidavit is to Establish as a Public Record the Revocation of Election ab initio by the American National Affiant who is Nonresident to the District of Columbia and Alien to that legislative jurisdiction.


Foundational Basis for Revocation of Election

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

The United States Supreme Court stipulated in Foley Brothers, Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281 (1949) that:

“It is a well established principle of law that all federal statutes and regulations applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States [the District of Columbia] unless a contrary intent appears [meaning if implementing regulations are published in the Federal Register].” [Emphasis & clarification added]

The Internal Revenue Service operates under Title 26 [the Internal Revenue Code] statutory laws and its lesser known Administrative, Procedural, and Implementing Regulations regarding federal income taxation found in Title 26 Code of Federal Regulations. These federal statutes and regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service are applicable only within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the District of Columbia per the US Supreme Court.

Thus, the IRS statutes and regulations are specifically limited in their geographical jurisdiction as well as the legislative jurisdiction for the application toward those who are the proper federal 'Taxpayers' as expressed in the IRC at 26 USC §7701 (a)(14).  The limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for IRS statutes and regulations is restricted to the District of Columbia by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment.

Statutory 'Taxpayers' are defined to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax." The statutory term 'person' as defined at 26 USC §7701 (a)(1) refers only to statutory legal fictions created by and under the dominion of the US Congress. The statutory term 'subject to' means 'under the dominion and control of the National Government'.

Established by the Constitution, the American People are the sovereign. As such the United States Supreme Court has declared in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) that:

"Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to the law for it is the author and source of the law."

It is therefore an imperative necessity to include the statement of legal opinion expressed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Cooper Corporation, 312 U.S. 600 (1941) in which this Court stated:

"Since in common usage, the term person does not include the sovereign, statutes not employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."

Thus, the statutory definition of 'person' found in 26 USC §7701(a)(1) and referred to in the statutory definition of Taxpayer at 26 USC §7701(a)(14) does not reflect or include in any fashion a reference to American Nationals who are the identified Sovereigns by birth in one of the 50 states of the Union or from parents who were born there.

Internal Revenue Service

Let it be known that the Internal Revenue Service, a federal bureau headquartered in Washington, DC, has promulgated in Title 26 of the United States Code [USC] a statutory legal option for those who are Nonresident Alien Individuals to implement the Termination at their discretion for any voluntary Federal Income Tax Election established at 26 USC §6013 (g) [Election to treat nonresident alien individual as resident of the United States].

Once a statutory 'election' under 26 USC §6013 (g) or (h) was initially established, those Nonresident Alien Individuals who made that 'election' immediately became a federal statutory 'Taxpayer' and their former nontaxable income is then deemed taxable in an identical manner to that of a US Resident Alien. The 'election' also became automatically applicable for all taxable years following as stated at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3) Duration of Election.

The Nonresident Alien Individual thus became 'voluntarily liable 'via this 'election' for a tax never levied upon them and all of their private sector employer paid wages were taxed under Chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. This wage withholding taxation was also automatically applicable for all taxable years following the initial 'election' as part of the Duration of Election section at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3).

The statutory term Nonresident Alien Individual is defined at 26 USC §7701 (b)(1)(B) and is expressed in this statute in the following manner: [definition is available at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701]

"An Individual is a Nonresident Alien if such individual is neither a  [statutory] citizen of the United States  [District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)] nor a resident  [Alien or foreigner from another nation] of the United States [District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)]." [Emphasis & Clarification added]

What is immediately noticeable is that the definition only tells the reader what a Nonresident Alien Individual is not rather than what it is. Such purposeful obfuscation is vitally important to recognize.

The true meaning of the statutory term Nonresident Alien Individual is none other than American Nationals who were born in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic]. This is amply illustrated in reading 26 CFR 1.871-1 (b) (4) Expatriation to avoid tax. This regulation section reads as follows:

"For special rules applicable in determining the tax of a nonresident alien individual who has lost U.S. citizenship with a principal purpose of avoiding certain taxes, see section 877."

In regard to Expatriation, only American Nationals [those born in one of the 50 states of the Union] can give up their Constitutional U.S. citizenship status and become a former member of the Constitutional Republic. Therefore, the 
term 'Nonresident Alien Individual' and 'American National' are synonymous.

The Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, written by former POTUS Taft documents that Congress was only able to levy the Federal Income Tax upon the National Government itself. Therefore, American Nationals who choose to work for the National Government are the primary statutory 'Taxpayers'.

Former POTUS Taft stipulated in the foundational document, the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment, that:

"The decision of the Supreme Court [Pollock v Farmer's Loan & Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429, 1895] in the income tax case deprived the National Government of a power which, by reason of previous decisions of the court, it was generally supposed that government had.

I therefore recommend to the Congress that both Houses, by a two-thirds vote, shall propose an amendment to the Constitution conferring the power to levy an income tax upon the National Government without apportionment among the States in proportion to population."

The power to ignore the Constitution only exists where it does not apply...the District of Columbia.

Nonresident Alien Individuals [American Nationals] are only liable for the Federal Income Tax if they choose to make a statutory 'election' [described at 26 CFR 1.871-1(a) Classification of Aliens] by filing a Form 1040 US Individual Income Tax Return for a tax they never were made liable for prior to the 'election'.  Per Clark v. United States, 95 U.S. 539, a statutory 'election' is not a valid contract.

Via 26 USC §6013(g) this statutory 'election' allows the National Government to treat or tax the income of those never imposed with the Federal Income Tax. American Nationals a.k.a. Nonresident Alien Individuals are then treated identically to that of foreigners who are legal Taxpayers called US Resident Aliens who live and work in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic] or the District of Columbia.

The Lack of Tax Liability and the right of Nonresident Alien Individuals to choose not to make an 'election' was established by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment written by former POTUS William H. Taft on June 16, 1909. American Nationals have always been Lawful Non Taxpayers as they were excluded. This foundational document which clears up the question of just who the parties are that the Federal Income Tax has actually been levied upon was promulgated in the Congressional Record of the United States Senate on pages 3344-3345.


The Federal Income Tax was only levied upon the National Government which is to say those Americans who have chosen to work for the National Government in one of its myriad of Public Offices. "Performing the functions of a public office" which is the statutory definition of a 'Trade or Business' per 26 USC §7701 (a)(26).

Within the regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service, one can locate the voluntary nature of Nonresident Alien Individuals [meaning American Nationals] being offered the option or choice to make an 'election' or not. By the fact that the 'election' is a choice, and therefore voluntary, the option to Americans has not been broadcast to the American Public. The voluntary choice to make an election or not, illustrates that the National Government has been successful in burdening Americans with an obligation that was never imposed by law outside of making an 'election'.

26 CFR 1.871-1 Classification and manner of taxing alien individuals is the regulation in particular that demonstrates the voluntary nature for American Nationals to exercise the choice to make an 'election' to have their income taxed or treated like that of a Resident Alien.

26 CFR 1.871-1 (a) Classes of aliens states:

" For purposes of the income tax, alien individuals are divided generally into two classes, namely, resident aliens and nonresident aliens. Resident alien individuals are, in general, taxable the same as [statutory] citizens [legal fictions] of the United States; that is, a resident alien is taxable on income derived from all sources, including sources without the United States. See § 1.1-1(b).

Nonresident alien individuals are taxable only on certain income from sources within the United States and on the income described in section 864(c)(4) from sources without the United States which  is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States [meaning only the District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)].

However, nonresident alien individuals [American Nationals] may elect, under section 6013 (g) or (h), to be treated as U.S. residents for purposes of determining their income tax liability under Chapters 1, 5, and 24 [wage withholding] of the code."   [Emphasis & Clarifications added]

The last paragraph above shows that Nonresident Alien Individuals or rather American Nationals are offered the choice by use of the statutory expression "may elect" to have their income treated [taxed] as that of a U.S. resident alien. The expression "may elect" clearly signifies that there is  no  mandatory obligation to file a Form 1040 US Individual Income Tax Return or pay that tax.

The lack of a mandatory obligation to file a Form 1040 return and pay the Federal Income Tax is further substantiated by the United States Department of the Treasury.

United States Department of the Treasury

As previously stated, those who work for the National Government have been lawfully levied with the federal income tax per the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment. The Legislative Intent excludes American Nationals from the federal income tax. Thus, sub silentio the 'election' amounts to a 'gift or bequest' as it was never mandatory.

Yet we see that the US Department of the Treasury states the federal income tax is a 'gift or bequest' indicating a matter of choice for American Nationals a.k.a. Nonresident Alien Individuals to 'donate' a 'gift or bequest' to and for the use of the National Government -- or to freely ignore making a donation.

The existence of both Lawful Taxpayers established via the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment and Lawful Non Taxpayers American Nationals excluded by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment is dramatically evident.

31 USC §321 (d)(1) & (d)(2) clearly illustrates that the Federal Income Tax is considered and acknowledged by the US Department of the Treasury to be a 'gift or bequest' that is paid for the expressed purpose and use of the [statutory] United States. Here is the exact statement by the US Department of the Treasury in their own statutory Title of the United States Code, Title 31.

31 USC §321 (d)(1) & (d)(2):

(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may accept, hold, administer, and use Gifts and bequests of property, both real and personal, for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of the Department of the Treasury. Gifts and bequests of money and the proceeds from sales of other proprty received as gifts or bequests shall be deposited in the Treasury in a separate fund and shall be disbursed on order of the Secretary of the Treasury. Property accepted under this paragraph, and the proceeds thereof, shall be used as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms of the gift or bequest.

(2) For purposes of the Federal income, estate, and gift taxes, property accepted under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a gift or bequest to or for the use of the United States.

Let it further be known that the expression by the U.S. Department of the Treasury reference to the statutory term "United States" in 31 USC §321 (d)(2) means and references only the National Government in the District of Columbia and not the 50 states of the Union per 26 USC §7408(d).

The IRS statutes refer only to the statutory United States being the District of Columbia unless a statutory section specifically refers to the "50 states".   The statute section reflecting this fact is 26 USC §7408(d).

26 USC §7408 (d) Citizens and residents outside the United States
If any citizen or  resident of  the United States does not  reside in, and does not  have his principal place of business in, any United States judicial district, such citizen or resident shall be treated for purposes of this section a s re siding in the District of Colu m bia.

The above IRS statute in Title 26 acknowledges the limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for the application of the federal income tax to be only the District of Columbia and other US Territories and possessions of the National Government. It entirely excludes any reference to the Constitutional Republic, the 50 states of the Union.

Stipulation of Facts made by this Affiant for the

REVOCATION OF ELECTION

[A]  All federal income taxation statutes and regulations apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the District of Columba, the seat of the National Government also known as the statutory 'United States', unless directly stated otherwise.

[B]  Sovereign American Nationals are not subject to the statutes and regulations, particularly Title 26, as they are limited in their geographical and legislative application to the District of Columbia as " sovereig n's are the author and source of the law"  according to the United States Supreme Court in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886).

[C]  The statutory definition of person used in statutes within the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 currently in use today in the territorial jurisdiction of the District of Columbia do not include or make reference to American Nationals as a result of the territorial limitations placed against the National Government per the Constitution. Such statutory words or phrases that illustrate this fact are highlighted in part as follows.

1. Person - defined at 26 USC §7701(a)(1) only referencing statutory legal fictions
2. U.S. person - defined at 26 USC §7701(a)(30) only referencing statutory legal fictions
3. Taxpayer - defined at 26 USC §7701(a)(14) references any 'person' subject to
4. U.S. Citizen - defined at 8 USC §1401(a)(1) only referencing a statutory legal fiction that was legislatively born in the District of Columbia and are property of the National Government and thus under the dominion or control of the National Government within its limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction.

[D]   As a result of the United States Supreme Court decision in United States v. Cooper Corporation, 312 

US 600 (1941) states that "the term ' person' does not include the sovereign and that statutes not employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it [the sovereign]."

The statutory term 'Nonresident Alien Individual' obtusely defined at 26 USC §7701 (b)(1)(B) was purposely stated in vague terms as it addresses sovereign American Nationals as the target of that definition without reference to the term sovereign specifically.

[E]  The Implementing Regulation 26 CFR §1.871-1(a) makes reference that Nonresident Alien Individuals can only be liable for the statutory laws of the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia if they choose to work for the National Government. Therefore, only federal workers derive income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a statutory ' trade or business' within the District of Columbia.

[F]  The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlaws and prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude in the Constitutional Republic. It however, does not outlaw voluntary indentured servitude. The National Government has utilized sub silentio acts directed at American Nationals to induce them by prevailing social custom and lack of awareness of the facts established by law to draw into their jurisdiction such American Nationals.

(1) 26 CFR §1.871-1(a) reflects the deception by the use of a statutory ' election' of a voluntary nature in order to make American Nationals liable for the federal income tax when the National Government was denied and deprived of such power by the United States Supreme Court in Pollock v. Farmer's Loan & Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429 (1895).

(2) The Legislative Intent of the Sixteenth Amendment written by former POTUS William H. Taft on June 16, 1909, documents the limited jurisdiction for the National Government to levy the federal income tax only upon itself.  The federal income tax cannot and does not extend into the jurisdiction of the current 50 states of the Union.

[G]  As evidence that the National Government cannot keep sovereign American Nationals so entrapped by the use of a statutory 'election' created by filing of a federal income tax return in perpetuity, the National Government has devised in its statutes a path for American Nationals referred to by the National Government as Nonresident Alien Individuals to exit, depart, and terminate forever the federal income tax scheme by use of 26 USC §6013(g)(4)(A) Termination of Election by Taxpayer.

[H]   The United States Department of the Treasury, an agency of the National Government, is directly complicit in the statutory election scheme as stipulated in its statutes at 31 USC §321 (d)(1) and (d)(2) by clearly stating the federal income tax is nothing more than a " g ift or bequest" of personal property [money] of an American National " to and for the use of the United States [meaning the National Government]". This statement eliminates the exposure of the National Government to legal action against the government by making the 'election' voluntary and then declaring that the money paid for the tax is nothing but a " g ift or bequest" at the same time.

[I]  The National Government use of statutory words are purposely obtuse for many sovereign American Nationals not trained in the art of legalese. The statutes are written in such a manner to allow the American Nationals to by default use their own definition of non statutory words to be misinterpreted as having the same meaning as to what the National Government defines their statutory words to mean. This presumption has proven to be a successful ruse by those in government who are willing to entrap their countrymen.

[J]  As a result of the convoluted semantic gamesmanship of words defined by the U.S. Congress the path to escape the entanglement of American Nationals into being identified statutorily as "Taxpayers" of the  federal income tax was discovered at 26 USC §6013 (4)(A).  This Revocation of Election is now implemented by the Affiant in order to extricate himself forever from any obligation created by the former sub silentio election.

[K]  The existence of lawful Non Taxpayers as related to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is described in two specific federal documents.

(1) The Legislative Intent of the Sixteenth Amendment written by former POTUS William H. Taft on June 16, 1909, and promulgated in the Congressional Record of the United States Senate on pages 3344-3345. This foundational document proves that the federal income tax as we know it today was never lawfully designed to be levied upon American Nationals, in fact the power of the National Government to do so was specifically denied to the government.  American Nationals were protected from the National Government attempting to include them as being the subject and the object of those federal statutory and regulatory laws.

(2) Economy Plumbing & Heating . U.S., 470 F2d. (1972) in which this appellate court declared the existence of two groups related to the federal income tax. Those groups are taxpayers and lawful non taxpayers. Those American Nationals, the lawful Non Taxpayers, were stated by this federal court to be neither the subject nor the object of federal revenue laws.

Let it be lawfully established by the presentment of this Affidavit Testimony that the Affiant expresses his desire to formally Terminate the former statutory Election via:

REVOCATION OF ELECTION

Revocation by Taxpayer [Nonresident Alien Individual meaning American National] who by a prior sub silentio government act made an 'election' to have their income treated or taxed like that of a Resident Alien, now expressly states the desire to lawfully terminate or end the prior election via the statutory process of Revocation of Election.

26 USC §6013(g)(4) addresses Termination of Election with a pertinent section at 26 USC §6013(g)(4)(A) Revocation by taxpayer. This statutory section stipulates that, "An election under this subsection shall terminate at the earliest of the following times". The 'earliest' time means 2 nanoseconds after IRS receipt of Affidavit.

The Affiant, Sovereign Publius, does hereby expressly state his desire to Terminate the Election made years ago via the Congressionally created statute(s) in 26 USC §6013(g). Even though the statutory election was never stated openly prior to that election, the Affiant's desire to Terminate the Election is now clearly stated to those appropriate IRS operational personnel, IRS management, IRS Chief Legal Counsel, and the IRS Commissioner.

As stipulated at 26 USC §6013(g)(4)(A), this Affiant now declares forevermore that he has exercised the option to Terminate the Election and upon receipt is no longer identified as one taxable like a Resident Alien. According to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 statutes promulgated at 26 USC §6013(g)(6) Only one election, one finds expressed in this particular statute that if any election under this subsection is terminated under paragraph (4) Termination of Election (A) Revocation by taxpayers, that such individual(s) shall be ineligible to make an election under this subsection for any subsequent taxable year. Thus, once a Termination of Election occurs, which is the purpose of this Affidavit, the Affiant can never again make an 'election' to become a taxpayer in the future.

Federal Appeals Court 2nd Circuit

The federal court decision in Economy Plumbing & Heating v. U.S., 470 F2d. (1972) stated the existence of both Lawful Taxpayers and Lawful Non Taxpayers.

“Revenue Laws relate to taxpayers and not to non-taxpayers. The latter are without their scope. No procedures are prescribed for non-taxpayers and no attempt is made to annul any of their Rights or Remedies in due course of law. With them [Non- taxpayers] Congress does not assume to deal and they are neither of the subject nor of the object of federal revenue laws."

The Affiant now reaffirms the desire and expressed intent to revert back to his rightful status of an American National who is "neither of the subject nor of the object of federal revenue laws."

Let it be established by the presentment in this Affidavit Testimony for the express purpose of REVOCATION OF ELECTION

1. Affiant is a sovereign American National and American Nationals become so by;
a) Birth of parent’s born in one of the 50 states of the Union.  Either parent being born of a Citizen of one of the 50 states. 
b) Or naturalized in one of the 50 states in a court having American Common Law jurisdiction.

The Affiant is NOT 'subject to' the territorial jurisdiction of the statutory United States [the District of Columbia] as a result of birth in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic].

2. The Affiant is NOT 'subject to' the territorial jurisdiction of the statutory United States [the District of Columbia] as a result of birth in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic].

(a) The Affiant is an American National who is nonresident, geographically and statutorily speaking, to the District of Columbia. The Affiant is also alien to the legislative jurisdiction of the US Congress who creates Legislative Acts without direct reference to the actual jurisdiction. Congressional laws are of limited jurisdiction. The Supreme Court declared, "...all  federal statutes and regulations applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States [the District of Columbia] unless a contrary intent appears."

3. The Affiant being a sovereign American National is not subject to the statutory laws promulgated for use in the exclusive and limited jurisdiction of the District of Columbia, the seat of the National Government.  Furthermore, the Affiant being a sovereign American National is not referenced or included in any statutory laws related to the federal income tax created by the U.S. Congress.

4. The Affiant cannot be compelled, goaded, or presumed to associate with the National Government which would be a direct violation of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawing slavery and involuntary servitude in the Constitutional Republic.

5. The Legislative Intent of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution clearly states that the Federal Income Tax was only levied upon the National Government [meaning those who choose to work for it]. The narrow jurisdictional application of the Federal Income Tax is evident due to the Amendment referring that it does not require adherence to the Constitutional Requirement of Apportionment based on Census as would be required of any direct tax.

(a) The Congressional Act of the Sixteenth Amendment avoids this limitation in the Constitution by only applying the Amendment to the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia, the statutory United States. The Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment acknowledges that former POTUS William H. Taft on June 16, 1909 recognized this territorial limitation for the levy of the federal income tax. The Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment can be located in the Congressional Record of the United States Senate on pages 3344-3345.

6. The Affiant does NOT derive any income that is "effectively connected with the conduct of a statutory 'Trade or Business' within the District of Columbia". Affiant has no tangible or statutory federal domicile.

7. The National Government, and its bureau - the Internal Revenue Service - lacks both geographical and legislative jurisdiction to apply the federal income tax upon this Affiant. American Nationals according to the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment, the US Supreme Court and the Office of the Federal Register, and the enacted federal tax laws presented have never been made liable for the federal income tax by enacted federal law except via the sub silentio 'election' based on presumptions of its existence.

8. The Affiant has discovered the statutory option provided by the U.S. Congress at 26 USC §6013(g) and its subsections and does now Revoke the Election, that was the etiology of the infectious financial statutory disease that has resulted in lost compensation for my labor over many years, created by the 

National Government.

(1) This REVOCATION OF ELECTION hereby made by the Affiant is effective immediately and is presented to the Office of the IRS Commissioner, et al, within the bureau of the Internal Revenue Service.

(2) As a result, the Internal Revenue Service has been effectively NOTICED of the REVOCATION OF ELECTION and that per 26 USC §6013(g)(6) the REVOCATION OF ELECTION is now permanent.

a. Never again can the Affiant be coerced, compelled, or goaded back into the nefariously created statutory scheme of the National Government. The Affiant must now be properly identified by those within the Internal Revenue Service as one who is a Lawful Non Taxpayer and that the scope of the statutory revenue laws within Title 26 are not applicable toward the Affiant. The Internal Revenue Service now recognizes by the REVOCATION OF ELECTION that the Affiant is neither the subject nor the object of federal revenue laws.

9. The Internal Revenue Service is now formally notified of the REVOCATION OF ELECTION by this Affiant and there can be no further discussion as to this Affiant ever being liable for making a federal income tax return. The IRS records and databases must now reflect this TERMINATION OF ELECTION.

This Affiant has ended the former taxation by election via this REVOCATION OF ELECTION that began sub silentio toward this Affiant.

Congress, and the IRS, now by statutory requirement recognizes this Affiant's rights as a lawful Non Taxpayer of the Congressional income taxation statutes and regulations.

Further affiant saith not.

UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, WHICH IS WITHOUT THE STATUTORY UNITED STATES [THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA] AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH 28 USC 1746(1) IN ORDER TO BE AS PRECISE AS POSSIBLE, DO HEREBY STATE THE FOLLOWING:

I, THE AFFIANT, DECLARE OR AFFIRM BY PENALTY OF PERJURY WITHOUT THE STATUTORY UNITED STATES THAT THE ABOVE AND FOREGOING REPRESENTATIONS, FEDERAL LAWS, AND ATTACHMENTS ARE TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, UNDERSTANDING, AND BELIEF.

Sovereign Publius  (Affiant)
