## Revocation of Election Affidavit- They Key to Reclaimimg Your Sovereignty

## Revocation of Election Affidavit

The purpose of this Affidavit is to Establish as a Public Record the Revocation of Election ab initio by the American National Affiant who is Nonresident to the District of Columbia and Alien to that legislative jurisdiction.


Foundational Basis for Revocation of Election

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

The United States Supreme Court stipulated in Foley Brothers, Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281 (1949) that:

“It is a well established principle of law that all federal statutes and regulations applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States [the District of Columbia] unless a contrary intent appears [meaning if implementing regulations are published in the Federal Register].” [Emphasis & clarification added]

The Internal Revenue Service operates under Title 26 [the Internal Revenue Code] statutory laws and its lesser known Administrative, Procedural, and Implementing Regulations regarding federal income taxation found in Title 26 Code of Federal Regulations. These federal statutes and regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service are applicable only within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the District of Columbia per the US Supreme Court.

Thus, the IRS statutes and regulations are specifically limited in their geographical jurisdiction as well as the legislative jurisdiction for the application toward those who are the proper federal 'Taxpayers' as expressed in the IRC at 26 USC §7701 (a)(14).  The limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for IRS statutes and regulations is restricted to the District of Columbia by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment.

Statutory 'Taxpayers' are defined to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax." The statutory term 'person' as defined at 26 USC §7701 (a)(1) refers only to statutory legal fictions created by and under the dominion of the US Congress. The statutory term 'subject to' means 'under the dominion and control of the National Government'.

Established by the Constitution, the American People are the sovereign. As such the United States Supreme Court has declared in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) that:

"Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to the law for it is the author and source of the law."

It is therefore an imperative necessity to include the statement of legal opinion expressed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Cooper Corporation, 312 U.S. 600 (1941) in which this Court stated:

"Since in common usage, the term person does not include the sovereign, statutes not employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."

Thus, the statutory definition of 'person' found in 26 USC §7701(a)(1) and referred to in the statutory definition of Taxpayer at 26 USC §7701(a)(14) does not reflect or include in any fashion a reference to American Nationals who are the identified Sovereigns by birth in one of the 50 states of the Union or from parents who were born there.

Internal Revenue Service

Let it be known that the Internal Revenue Service, a federal bureau headquartered in Washington, DC, has promulgated in Title 26 of the United States Code [USC] a statutory legal option for those who are Nonresident Alien Individuals to implement the Termination at their discretion for any voluntary Federal Income Tax Election established at 26 USC §6013 (g) [Election to treat nonresident alien individual as resident of the United States].

Once a statutory 'election' under 26 USC §6013 (g) or (h) was initially established, those Nonresident Alien Individuals who made that 'election' immediately became a federal statutory 'Taxpayer' and their former nontaxable income is then deemed taxable in an identical manner to that of a US Resident Alien. The 'election' also became automatically applicable for all taxable years following as stated at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3) Duration of Election.

The Nonresident Alien Individual thus became 'voluntarily liable 'via this 'election' for a tax never levied upon them and all of their private sector employer paid wages were taxed under Chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. This wage withholding taxation was also automatically applicable for all taxable years following the initial 'election' as part of the Duration of Election section at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3).

The statutory term Nonresident Alien Individual is defined at 26 USC §7701 (b)(1)(B) and is expressed in this statute in the following manner: [definition is available at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701]
