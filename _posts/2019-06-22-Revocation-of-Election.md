## Foundational Basis for Revocation of Election







UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

The United States Supreme Court stipulated in Foley Brothers, Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281 (1949) that:

“It is a well established principle of law that all federal statutes and regulations applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States [the District of Columbia] unless a contrary intent appears [meaning if implementing regulations are published in the Federal Register].” [Emphasis & clarification added]

The Internal Revenue Service operates under Title 26 [the Internal Revenue Code] statutory laws and its lesser known Administrative, Procedural, and Implementing Regulations regarding federal income taxation found in Title 26 Code of Federal Regulations. These federal statutes and regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service are applicable only within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the District of Columbia per the US Supreme Court.

Thus, the IRS statutes and regulations are specifically limited in their geographical jurisdiction as well as the legislative jurisdiction for the application toward those who are the proper federal 'Taxpayers' as expressed in the IRC at 26 USC
§7701 (a)(14).  The limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for IRS statutes and regulations is restricted to the
District of Columbia by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment.

Statutory 'Taxpayers' are defined to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax." The statutory term 'person' as defined at 26 USC §7701 (a)(1) refers only to statutory legal fictions created by and under the dominion of the US Congress. The statutory term 'subject to' means 'under the dominion and control of the National Government'.

Established by the Constitution, the American People are the sovereign. As such the United States Supreme Court has declared in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) that:

"Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to the law for it is the author and source of the law."

It is therefore an imperative necessity to include the statement of legal opinion expressed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Cooper Corporation, 312 U.S. 600 (1941) in which this Court stated:

"Since in common usage, the term person does not include the sovereign, statutes not employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."

Thus, the statutory definition of 'person' found in 26 USC §7701(a)(1) and referred to in the statutory definition of Taxpayer at 26 USC §7701(a)(14) does not reflect or include in any fashion a reference to American Nationals who
