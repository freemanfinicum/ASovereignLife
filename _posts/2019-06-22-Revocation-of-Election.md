## Revocation of Election Affidavit- They Key to Reclaimimg Your Sovereignty

## Revocation of Election Affidavit

The purpose of this Affidavit is to Establish as a Public Record the Revocation of Election ab initio by the American National Affiant who is Nonresident to the District of Columbia and Alien to that legislative jurisdiction.


Foundational Basis for Revocation of Election

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

The United States Supreme Court stipulated in Foley Brothers, Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281 (1949) that:

“It is a well established principle of law that all federal statutes and regulations applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States [the District of Columbia] unless a contrary intent appears [meaning if implementing regulations are published in the Federal Register].” [Emphasis & clarification added]

The Internal Revenue Service operates under Title 26 [the Internal Revenue Code] statutory laws and its lesser known Administrative, Procedural, and Implementing Regulations regarding federal income taxation found in Title 26 Code of Federal Regulations. These federal statutes and regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service are applicable only within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the District of Columbia per the US Supreme Court.

Thus, the IRS statutes and regulations are specifically limited in their geographical jurisdiction as well as the legislative jurisdiction for the application toward those who are the proper federal 'Taxpayers' as expressed in the IRC at 26 USC §7701 (a)(14).  The limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for IRS statutes and regulations is restricted to the District of Columbia by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment.

Statutory 'Taxpayers' are defined to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax." The statutory term 'person' as defined at 26 USC §7701 (a)(1) refers only to statutory legal fictions created by and under the dominion of the US Congress. The statutory term 'subject to' means 'under the dominion and control of the National Government'.

Established by the Constitution, the American People are the sovereign. As such the United States Supreme Court has declared in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) that:

"Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to the law for it is the author and source of the law."

It is therefore an imperative necessity to include the statement of legal opinion expressed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Cooper Corporation, 312 U.S. 600 (1941) in which this Court stated:

"Since in common usage, the term person does not include the sovereign, statutes not employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."

Thus, the statutory definition of 'person' found in 26 USC §7701(a)(1) and referred to in the statutory definition of Taxpayer at 26 USC §7701(a)(14) does not reflect or include in any fashion a reference to American Nationals who are the identified Sovereigns by birth in one of the 50 states of the Union or from parents who were born there.

Internal Revenue Service

Let it be known that the Internal Revenue Service, a federal bureau headquartered in Washington, DC, has promulgated in Title 26 of the United States Code [USC] a statutory legal option for those who are Nonresident Alien Individuals to implement the Termination at their discretion for any voluntary Federal Income Tax Election established at 26 USC §6013 (g) [Election to treat nonresident alien individual as resident of the United States].

Once a statutory 'election' under 26 USC §6013 (g) or (h) was initially established, those Nonresident Alien Individuals who made that 'election' immediately became a federal statutory 'Taxpayer' and their former nontaxable income is then deemed taxable in an identical manner to that of a US Resident Alien. The 'election' also became automatically applicable for all taxable years following as stated at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3) Duration of Election.

The Nonresident Alien Individual thus became 'voluntarily liable 'via this 'election' for a tax never levied upon them and all of their private sector employer paid wages were taxed under Chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. This wage withholding taxation was also automatically applicable for all taxable years following the initial 'election' as part of the Duration of Election section at 26 USC §6013 (g) (3).

The statutory term Nonresident Alien Individual is defined at 26 USC §7701 (b)(1)(B) and is expressed in this statute in the following manner: [definition is available at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701]

"An Individual is a Nonresident Alien if such individual is neither a  [statutory] citizen of the United States  [District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)] nor a resident  [Alien or foreigner from another nation] of the United States [District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)]." [Emphasis & Clarification added]

What is immediately noticeable is that the definition only tells the reader what a Nonresident Alien Individual is not rather than what it is. Such purposeful obfuscation is vitally important to recognize.

The true meaning of the statutory term Nonresident Alien Individual is none other than American Nationals who were born in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic]. This is amply illustrated in reading 26 CFR 1.871-1 (b) (4) Expatriation to avoid tax. This regulation section reads as follows:

"For special rules applicable in determining the tax of a nonresident alien individual who has lost U.S. citizenship with a principal purpose of avoiding certain taxes, see section 877."

In regard to Expatriation, only American Nationals [those born in one of the 50 states of the Union] can give up their Constitutional U.S. citizenship status and become a former member of the Constitutional Republic. Therefore, the 
term 'Nonresident Alien Individual' and 'American National' are synonymous.

The Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, written by former POTUS Taft documents that Congress was only able to levy the Federal Income Tax upon the National Government itself. Therefore, American Nationals who choose to work for the National Government are the primary statutory 'Taxpayers'.

Former POTUS Taft stipulated in the foundational document, the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment, that:

"The decision of the Supreme Court [Pollock v Farmer's Loan & Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429, 1895] in the income tax case deprived the National Government of a power which, by reason of previous decisions of the court, it was generally supposed that government had.

I therefore recommend to the Congress that both Houses, by a two-thirds vote, shall propose an amendment to the Constitution conferring the power to levy an income tax upon the National Government without apportionment among the States in proportion to population."

The power to ignore the Constitution only exists where it does not apply...the District of Columbia.

Nonresident Alien Individuals [American Nationals] are only liable for the Federal Income Tax if they choose to make a statutory 'election' [described at 26 CFR 1.871-1(a) Classification of Aliens] by filing a Form 1040 US Individual Income Tax Return for a tax they never were made liable for prior to the 'election'.  Per Clark v. United States, 95 U.S. 539, a statutory 'election' is not a valid contract.

Via 26 USC §6013(g) this statutory 'election' allows the National Government to treat or tax the income of those never imposed with the Federal Income Tax. American Nationals a.k.a. Nonresident Alien Individuals are then treated identically to that of foreigners who are legal Taxpayers called US Resident Aliens who live and work in one of the 50 states of the Union [the Constitutional Republic] or the District of Columbia.

The Lack of Tax Liability and the right of Nonresident Alien Individuals to choose not to make an 'election' was established by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment written by former POTUS William H. Taft on June 16, 1909. American Nationals have always been Lawful Non Taxpayers as they were excluded. This foundational document which clears up the question of just who the parties are that the Federal Income Tax has actually been levied upon was promulgated in the Congressional Record of the United States Senate on pages 3344-3345.


The Federal Income Tax was only levied upon the National Government which is to say those Americans who have chosen to work for the National Government in one of its myriad of Public Offices. "Performing the functions of a public office" which is the statutory definition of a 'Trade or Business' per 26 USC §7701 (a)(26).

Within the regulations used by the Internal Revenue Service, one can locate the voluntary nature of Nonresident Alien Individuals [meaning American Nationals] being offered the option or choice to make an 'election' or not. By the fact that the 'election' is a choice, and therefore voluntary, the option to Americans has not been broadcast to the American Public. The voluntary choice to make an election or not, illustrates that the National Government has been successful in burdening Americans with an obligation that was never imposed by law outside of making an 'election'.

26 CFR 1.871-1 Classification and manner of taxing alien individuals is the regulation in particular that demonstrates the voluntary nature for American Nationals to exercise the choice to make an 'election' to have their income taxed or treated like that of a Resident Alien.

26 CFR 1.871-1 (a) Classes of aliens states:

" For purposes of the income tax, alien individuals are divided generally into two classes, namely, resident aliens and nonresident aliens. Resident alien individuals are, in general, taxable the same as [statutory] citizens [legal fictions] of the United States; that is, a resident alien is taxable on income derived from all sources, including sources without the United States. See § 1.1-1(b).

Nonresident alien individuals are taxable only on certain income from sources within the United States and on the income described in section 864(c)(4) from sources without the United States which  is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States [meaning only the District of Columbia per 26 USC §7408(d)].

However, nonresident alien individuals [American Nationals] may elect, under section 6013 (g) or (h), to be treated as U.S. residents for purposes of determining their income tax liability under Chapters 1, 5, and 24 [wage withholding] of the code."   [Emphasis & Clarifications added]

The last paragraph above shows that Nonresident Alien Individuals or rather American Nationals are offered the choice by use of the statutory expression "may elect" to have their income treated [taxed] as that of a U.S. resident alien. The expression "may elect" clearly signifies that there is  no  mandatory obligation to file a Form 1040 US Individual Income Tax Return or pay that tax.

The lack of a mandatory obligation to file a Form 1040 return and pay the Federal Income Tax is further substantiated by the United States Department of the Treasury.

United States Department of the Treasury

As previously stated, those who work for the National Government have been lawfully levied with the federal income tax per the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment. The Legislative Intent excludes American Nationals from the federal income tax. Thus, sub silentio the 'election' amounts to a 'gift or bequest' as it was never mandatory.

Yet we see that the US Department of the Treasury states the federal income tax is a 'gift or bequest' indicating a matter of choice for American Nationals a.k.a. Nonresident Alien Individuals to 'donate' a 'gift or bequest' to and for the use of the National Government -- or to freely ignore making a donation.

The existence of both Lawful Taxpayers established via the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment and Lawful Non Taxpayers American Nationals excluded by the Legislative Intent of the 16th Amendment is dramatically evident.

31 USC §321 (d)(1) & (d)(2) clearly illustrates that the Federal Income Tax is considered and acknowledged by the US Department of the Treasury to be a 'gift or bequest' that is paid for the expressed purpose and use of the [statutory]United States. Here is the exact statement by the US Department of the Treasury in their own statutory Title of the United States Code, Title 31.

31 USC §321 (d)(1) & (d)(2):

    (1) The Secretary of the Treasury may accept, hold, administer, and use gifts and bequests of property,  both real  and  personal,  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  or  facilitating  the  work  of  the Department of the Treasury. Gifts and bequests of money and the proceeds from sales of other property received as gifts or bequests shall be deposited in the Treasury in a separate fund and shall be disbursed on order of the Secretary of the Treasury.  Property accepted under this paragraph, and the proceeds thereof, shall be used as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms of the gift or bequest.
    (2) For  purposes  of  the  Federal  income, estate, and gift taxes, property accepted under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a gift or bequest to or for the use of the United States.



    (1) The Secretary of the Treasury may accept, hold, administer, and use gifts and bequests of property,  both real  and  personal,  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  or  facilitating  the  work  of  the Department of the Treasury. Gifts and bequests of money and the proceeds from sales of other property received as gifts or bequests shall be deposited in the Treasury in a separate fund and shall be disbursed on order of the Secretary of the Treasury.  Property accepted under this paragraph, and the proceeds thereof, shall be used as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms of the gift or bequest.


    (2) For  purposes  of  the  Federal  income,  estate,  and  gift  taxes,  property  accepted  under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a gift or bequest to or for the use of the United States.

    (1) The Secretary of the Treasury may accept, hold, administer, and use gifts and bequests of property,  both real  and  personal,  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  or  facilitating  the  work  of  the Department of the Treasury. Gifts and bequests of money and the proceeds from sales of other property received as gifts or bequests shall be deposited in the Treasury in a separate fund and shall be disbursed on order of the Secretary of the Treasury.  Property accepted under this paragraph, and the proceeds thereof, shall be used as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms of the gift or bequest.

    (2) For  purposes  of  the  Federal  income,  estate,  and  gift  taxes,  property  accepted  under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a gift or bequest to or for the use of the United States.

Let it further be known that the expression by the U.S. Department of the Treasury reference to the statutory term "United States" in 31 USC §321 (d)(2) means and references only the National Government in the District of Columbia and not the 50 states of the Union per 26 USC §7408(d).

The IRS statutes refer only to the statutory United States being the District of Columbia unless a statutory section specifically refers to the "50 states".   The statute section reflecting this fact is 26 USC §7408(d).

26 USC §7408 (d) Citizens and residents outside the United States
If any citizen or  resident of  the United States does not  reside in, and does not  have his principal place of business in, any United States judicial district, such citizen or resident shall be treated for purposes of this section a s re siding in the District of Columbia.

The above IRS statute in Title 26 acknowledges the limited geographical and legislative jurisdiction for the application of the federal income tax to be only the District of Columbia and other US Territories and possessions of the National Government. It entirely excludes any reference to the Constitutional Republic, the 50 states of the Union.
